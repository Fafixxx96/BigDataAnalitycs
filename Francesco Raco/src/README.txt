In this folder you will find two python scripts:

-- "spotifyGroupingService" is the script implementing the service itself, which can be run
    after inserting a given user's credentials.

-- "genreClassifier" contains the study I did in order to be able to implement the 
   "spotifyGroupingService": here I tried clustering and classification algorithms with different
    parameters to chose the proper configurations.
