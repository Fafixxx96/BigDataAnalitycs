# BigDataAnalitycs
BDA project's Repository

Team: Fabio Capparelli - Luigi Rachiele - Francesco Raco

Guide lines:

- Select a web platform (Facebook, YouTube ..)
- Register to the DEVELOP API (a sort of key authentication to use the platform interface)
- Use the API to query data into the platform
- Extrack all meaningfull data about your problem
- Use data extracked to train some ML model.

Anyway we can propose something else that has to be related to the topics learnt during the course.
For instance:

- Instead of considering a web platform to extrack data, we can use directly some datasets and train our ML model.
